# ExampleInventory
 
This repository houses an Unreal 4.27 project which demonstrates a basic inventory system.

Tab opens the players inventory.
If the player walks near an item in the world, that item will become visible as an entry in the Nearby section of the inventory UI.
Clicking on this UI element will pick up that item, removing the object from the game world and adding a UI element in the conventional inventory on the left of the screen in the inventory UI.
Clicking on an element from the conventional inventory will spawn that object into the game world, whereby it can then be picked up again if the player walks nearby.
